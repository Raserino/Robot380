# Robot380

Robot380 is a project I did for the University of Waterloo's ME 380 Design Workshop course. The task to build a robot that is able to perform a pick and place operation with special design objectives. We aimed to make our robot as fast as possible and adaptable to different colours.

We were able to achieve a completion time for the whole pick-place-operation of only 1.2 seconds.
The colour determination worked with an accuracy of >95%.

My responsibility within the project was the controls and the software of the robot.
